# PPT-SeedFinder

hi, i used this to make [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0fYDnwZOf8) and [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5nGTGvPZUI).

ppt1 is nice and has really cool solves, 10/10

ppt2 rng sucks and loops all over the place with no good seeds, to the point where i never bothered to make a tas sprint video out of it

use at your own risk
